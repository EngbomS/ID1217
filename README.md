# ID1217
This repository will consist of my course work during the course ID1217.
The homework we do in the course reflect the learning outcomes of the course which are:
Concurrent programming concepts, models, and paradigms.
Multithreaded and parallel programming with threads and shared variables.

    Processes and threads.
    Mutual exclusion and condition synchronization.
    Introduction to axiomatic semantics of concurrent programs.
    The critical section problem, locks and condition variables, and barriers. Data parallelism.
    Selective mutual exclusion problems.
    Semaphores, monitors, and concurrent objects (locking, lock-free, wait-free).
    Multicore architectures and systems; task-centric programming models; performance models.
    OS support for processes and synchronization in a single processor and a multiprocessor.
    Concurrent programming environment: pthreads, openMP, Java threads, and concurrent utilities.

Distributed programming with processes.

    Distributed programming with message passing, RPC, RMI, and rendezvous. 
    Paradigms for process interaction.
    Distributed programming environments: Java Socket API, Java RMI, MPI.
